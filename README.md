# Supermarket Together Pricing Accessibility

A tool to make setting prices in [Supermarket Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2709570/Supermarket_Together/)
easier and more effective during early gameplay.

[Supermarket Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2709570/Supermarket_Together/)
is a multiplayer supermarket simulator where you can manually
set the prices for your products with a little hand scanner. 
That scanner is operated with the numpad keys. 
The game tells you, that customers won't buy something if it costs
more than double of the "global market" price.  
Also our cashiers, aka my friends, found it tedious if a price 
wasn't nicely rounded to five cents. 

So this program does just that: Double whatever price you give it 
and round it down to the next five cents. 
Then send the corresponding numpad inputs to your computer. 

## Usage

This project is still in early development and missing many
core features. Once that changes, this section will be updated.
